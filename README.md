# Fish-Game

This is a two-player text-based Fishing Tournament game program built using object classes for different types of fish we implemented. 
- Two players will alternate turns on the same computer.
- The players will catch fish and put them into a "sack" (an ArrayList, sorted in descending order by length)
- After 12 turns each, the player with the three largest fish wins.

Player 1, it is your turn! 
* Choose:
  1. Cast out for a fish
